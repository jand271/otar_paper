abstract = {Abstract GNSS vulnerabilities have become evident in the last decade. Authentication of the GNSS signals and data can be an important building block contributing to mitigating these vulnerabilities. This paper presents a Navigation Message Authentication (NMA) scheme based on the Timed Efficient Stream Loss-tolerant Authentication (TESLA) protocol and a novel concept based on a single one-way chain for all senders and cross-authentication. The paper presents an NMA implementation in the Galileo Open Service (OS) navigation message that should provide similar navigation performance to data-authenticated users and standard non-authenticated users in terms of time to first fix, accuracy, and availability even in difficult reception conditions. The proposal also maintains a high level of signal unpredictability to help receivers protect against replay attacks. The scheme and implementation proposed yield significant improvements compared to the state of the art, offering the opportunity for Galileo to become the reference GNSS in civil navigation authentication.

abstract = {Abstract Integral to any authentication system is the design of its public key infrastructure (PKI), allowing the system to distribute, maintain, and revoke cryptographic keys while dividing and allocating the responsibility of security between different entities. This paper develops a PKI for two SBAS candidate authentication schemes: one each for an L5 I-channel and Q-channel implementation. A simulator, introduced as MCOS, is developed to enable large scale Monte Carlo tests of these PKI designs. This work concludes that once a receiver has been deployed with a set of preinstalled encrypted public keys, a strictly over-the-air method of delivering PKI information is feasible for SBAS data authentication in nominal conditions. This work also provides a strong candidate PKI that is designed to be standardized internationally for current and future SBAS service providers.},
